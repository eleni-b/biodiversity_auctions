# Budget-Feasible Market Design for Biodiversity Conservation

This repository contains code and data evaluating the performance of various mechanisms for conservation auctions. We examine novel and established auction algorithms and assess their suitability for the purpose of biodiversity conservation from the perspective of a budget-constrained authority. The algorithms implemented include: 
1. VCG auction algorithm
2. Budget-feasible clock auctions of Balkanski et al. (2022)
3. Optimal solution via winner determination problem
