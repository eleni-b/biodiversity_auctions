# Budget-Feasible Market Design for Biodiversity Conservation

This repository contains code and data evaluating the performance of various mechanisms for conservation auctions. We examine novel and established auction algorithms and assess their suitability for the purpose of biodiversity conservation from the perspective of a budget-constrained authority.

## Usage

The experimental code, generating valuations for land items, costs as well as implementing and evaluating the auction algorithm on different value function models is contained entirely within run_all.py. To invoke the script, select a random seed on choice and run:
`python run_all.py <random seed>`
